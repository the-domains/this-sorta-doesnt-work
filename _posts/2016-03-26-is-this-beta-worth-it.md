So far, I have no idea how this thing works. And it goes against everything I've known and learned about building/designing a website. I can't stress enough how frustrating that is. I can't undersell the value of what this has brought me so far in just being weird, cryptic, and broken.

It's not my first beta. But you know - most betas I've been in have had way more instruction and intuitive interfaces than whatever the hell this is. I have no way of knowing what's even happening. I have no creative control over my fonts and that is supremely upsetting.

For that matter, I have no way of defining my brand. I have a logo. I have a branded type I want to use. I have a Typekit account. But I'm only getting these shitty Google Fonts pairings that - frankly - someone put together and didn't think about too carefully because they all look terrible.
